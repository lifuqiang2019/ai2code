# Interview Tasks

Welcome to the our take-home project interview! 👋

Please complete the tasks below and submit your solution as a zip file (excluding the node_modules folder to save space). Bonus tasks are optional.

**You're encouraged to use AI agents to help complete these tasks.**

## What We're Looking For

- **Product Thinking**: Making smart decisions when requirements aren't crystal clear
- **Code Quality**: Clean, maintainable, and well-structured code
- **AI Usage**: Understanding AI-generated code and making it better, not just settling for "it works"

**Remember:** Quality beats quantity every time. It's much better to nail a few tasks than to rush through everything.

Good luck! You've got this! 🚀

#### Task A1: Add Useful Shapes
Expand the shape options beyond Rectangle and Triangle.

#### Task A2: Undo/Redo
Add the ability to undo and redo recent actions.

#### Task A3: Settings Persistence
Currently, when users configure stroke properties (color, width) for an element and then disable the stroke, those settings are lost when re-enabling stroke. Implement a solution to preserve stroke configurations so users can toggle stroke on/off without losing their customization.

#### Bonus Task A4: Layers Panel with Stacking Order Control
Create a layers panel that displays all elements in the canvas with their stacking order. Allow users to reorder layers by dragging them in the panel.

#### Bonus Task A5: Export and Import
Add the ability to export the canvas design as JSON and import previously saved designs. Consider adding validation for imported data.
